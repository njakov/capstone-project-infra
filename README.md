# Advanced Capstone Project: Cloud Infrastructure


This repository is a part of the DevOps Capstone Project for DevOps Internship in GridDynamics.

* This repository contains the **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** implementation: it uses **Terraform** to provision a scalable, secure, and automated Kubernetes-based architecture on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
* The infrastructure is designed to host a Java Spring PetClinic application with high availability, automated CI/CD pipelines, and strict security practices.

Here, you can find the code for:
* Creating Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner 
* Dev & Production Environment Provisioning
* Custom Modules Repository
* Architecture Diagram

## Architecture

The infrastructure follows a modular design with environment separation (`dev`, `prod`) and a bootstrap layer.

### Key Components
1.  **Network (`modules/network`):**
    * Custom VPC with private subnets.
    * **Cloud NAT:** Allows private nodes to access the internet for updates without exposing public IPs.
    * **IAP Tunneling:** SSH access to internal VMs (Runners) is restricted to Identity-Aware Proxy; no public SSH ports are open.
2.  **Compute (`modules/gke` & `modules/runner`):**
    * **GKE:** Private cluster with VPC-native networking. Autoscaling enabled (1-3 nodes) based on CPU usage.
    * **GitHub Runner:** A dedicated VM in the private subnet acting as a self-hosted runner for CI/CD pipelines. It comes pre-installed with Docker, Terraform, Helm, Java 25, and security scanners (TFSec, TFLint).
3.  **Database (`modules/cloud-sql`):**
    * Cloud SQL (MySQL 8.0) connected via Private Service Access (VPC Peering).
    * Passwords are generated randomly and stored immediately in **Google Secret Manager**.
4.  **Security:**
    * **Workload Identity:** GKE Service Accounts map to GCP Service Accounts for fine-grained permissions.
    * **Secret Manager:** Centralized management for DB credentials and URLs.
    * **Least Privilege:** Custom Service Accounts with specific IAM roles for Runners and Nodes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  

1.  **GCP Project:** You must have a Google Cloud Project ID (e.g., `my-gcp-project`).  
2.  **Google Cloud SDK:** Installed and authenticated locally.  
3.  **Terraform:** Installed (v1.14+).  

### Step 1: Initial GCP Setup  
Run the setup script to enable required APIs (KMS, Storage, IAM), create the Terraform State Bucket, and set up the Service Account with necessary permissions. 
 
```bash  chmod +x scripts/setup_gcp.sh  ./scripts/setup_gcp.sh   ```

*   **What this does:** This script executes create-bucket.sh to provision the GCS backend with versioning and setup-terraform-sa.sh to create the Service Account and assign IAM roles.
    

### Step 2: Bootstrap Environment (Network & Runner)

Before deploying the application infrastructure, you must bootstrap the environment. This layer creates the VPC, Subnets, and the Self-Hosted Runner VM required for the CI/CD pipelines.

```bash  chmod +x scripts/bootstra-env.sh  ./scripts/bootstrap-env.sh <ENV-NAME>  ```

*   **What this does:** This script initializes Terraform in environments/bootstrap and applies the configuration using the corresponding .tfvars file (e.g., dev.tfvars).

*   **Output:** Upon completion, it will output the runner\_ssh\_command needed to access the private runner VM.
    

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

To allow the pipelines to run successfully, add the following secrets to your GitHub Repository settings:

*   GCP\_PROJECT\_ID: Your Project ID (e.g., my-project-id).
    
*   GCP\_REGION: The region for resources (e.g., europe-west1).
    
*   TF\_STATE\_BUCKET: The name of the GCS bucket created in Step 1 (e.g., terraform-state-bucket-my-project-id).
    

CI/CD Pipelines
------------------

The project utilizes **GitHub Actions** with a self-hosted runner located inside the private VPC. The runner is pre-configured via a startup script to include Docker, Terraform, Helm, and Java.

### Dev Infrastructure Pipeline (dev-only-pipeline.yml)

*   **Trigger:** Pushes to the dev branch or manual workflow\_dispatch.
    
*   **Jobs:**
    
    *   **Validate & Scan:** Runs terraform fmt, terraform validate, tflint, and tfsec to ensure code quality and security.
        
    *   **Plan:** Generates a speculative execution plan.
        
    *   **Apply:** Manual trigger required to apply changes to the Dev environment.
        
    *   **Destroy:** Manual trigger required to tear down resources.
        

### Main Infrastructure Pipeline (infra-pipeline.yml)

*   **Trigger:** Pushes to the main branch.
    
*   **Protection:** Enforces that Production deployments can **only** occur from the main branch. If a prod deployment is attempted from another branch, it exits with an error.
    
*   **Workflow:** Similar to Dev, but targets the prod environment state and workspace.
    
### Deployment Pipelines

This repository utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the software delivery process. The workflows are located in `.github/workflows`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PR Release** (`pr-release.yml`) | Pull Request | Runs on every PR. Performs unit tests, static code analysis, and security scanning (Trivy) to ensure code quality before merging. |
| **Main Release** (`main-release.yml`) | Push to `main` | Runs when code is merged to main. bumps the Semantic Version, builds the Docker image, tags it with the new version, and pushes it to the Container Registry (GCR/Artifact Registry). |
| **Manual Deploy** (`manual-deploy.yml`) | Manual Dispatch | A manual workflow to deploy a specific version of the application to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm. |
## Tools & Technologies Used

| Category | Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IaC** | Terraform | Infrastructure provisioning (v1.14+). |
| **State** | GCS | Remote backend with versioning enabled. |
| **Container** | Docker | Application packaging and registry management. |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes (GKE) | Container management with VPC-native networking. |
| **Charts** | Helm | Deploying Nginx Ingress and Prometheus stack. |
| **Security** | TFSec / TFLint | Static analysis for Terraform code. |
| **Secrets** | Secret Manager | Secure storage for Database credentials and URLs. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automation pipelines running on self-hosted runners. |

Monitoring & Middleware
--------------------------

The modules/middleware module installs essential shared services into the cluster via Helm:

1.  **Nginx Ingress Controller:** Managed via Helm, configured as a LoadBalancer (type: ClusterIP) with restricted source ranges.
    
2.  **Kube Prometheus Stack:** Deploys Prometheus and Grafana into the monitoring namespace for cluster metrics and visualization.

Important Notes
------------------

*   **State Management:** The Terraform state is stored remotely in a GCS bucket.
    
*   **Security:** Public access to the database is disabled. The Cloud SQL instance only allows connections via Private Service Access (VPC Peering).
    
*   **SSH Access:** SSH access to the runner is restricted to IAP tunneling; 
    
*   **Cost:** This infrastructure creates real resources (GKE Cluster, Load Balancers, Cloud SQL). Remember to run the **Destroy** workflow.
